            "question": "When was Imani + Kids started?",
            "answer": "<p>Imani Collective officially began in 2013 and was originally launched as Imani Tumaini Upendo (which in Swahili means Faith, Hope, Love.) We started with 16 women in the Mtepeni Village just outside Mombasa, Kenya. In 2017, we rebranded as Imani Collective. Since then, we have grown to empower over 100 artisans in three different Kenyan locations. In 2023, Imani Collective became an umbrella to multiple brands that empower our artisans. Imani + Kids became the sub brand that focuses on creating children’s decor and toys.

Do not iron on the front side directly on the screen  print. Do not use high heat or keep iron in one place for too long. You can also steam the banner, but steam from the back side of the banner.
